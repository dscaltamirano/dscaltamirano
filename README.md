I work on GPU-accelerated research and performance engineering.

My focus includes:
- CUDA C++ kernel design and optimization
- Performance analysis (memory-bound vs compute-bound workloads)
- Reproducible benchmarks for research and applied systems

I am particularly interested in accelerating research workloads,
including statistical methods, computer vision, and custom CUDA extensions.
